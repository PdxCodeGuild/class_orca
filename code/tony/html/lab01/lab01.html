Hatsune miku is a wild japanese idol.<br><br>
She's a pop sensation seen 'round the world, but how does she do it?
well, she isn't real!<br>
Hatsune Miku is a "Vocaloid," a voice synthesizer software developed at Yamaha Corporation.  
Miku was not the first of her kind, as there were plenty of voice banks before her, but she was the first to receieve a personality and character design.<br><br>
She was an big hit in Japan almost instantly, but took a few years to come around to the Western market.<br>
Even with the delay, her popularity didn't slow down, and it wasn't long until she had tons of merch and related products.<br><br>
In 2009, she performed a "live" concert, where video of her 3D model is projected onto a large glass display at the venue, and gives the illusion of performing onstage.<br>
(Her accompanying band, however, is 100% real) <br>
Since then, Crypton Future Media (the company behind Vocaloid) holds many of these concerts per year all over the world.<br><br>
