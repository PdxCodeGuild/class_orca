    <h2>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Lisa Stevens is the CEO of Paizo Inc., mainly known for its flagship product, The Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Lisa has a long history in the tabletop gaming industry. She worked for Whitewolf before becoming "employee zero" at a fledgling Wizards of the Coast. At Wizards, she helped oversee projects like Magic the Gathering and purchasing then-D&D-publisher TSR. She left WotC after it was purchased by Hasbro and subsequently bought WotC old magazine rights, until the internet killed the magazine industry. Her and her husband then started their own company, called Paizo, and began producing content for D&D. Once it became clear that Wizards would not allow 3rd party publishers to create content for their new 4th edition of the game, Paizo shifted its focus to creating its own game, Pathfinder, based off of D&D 3.5 edition. She has remained there as CEO until 2020 and has announced plans to start stepping away from responsibilities in preparation for retirement. Lisa and her husband also one of the largest collections of Star Wars items in the world.

    <h2>A fun story</h2>
      <p id="quote">I once heard her tell a story about how her small gaming company at the time had won an award at a game show or convention. Some bigwigs from TSR, important looking guys in suits, came to their booth to check out their product. One guy picked up their book and leafed through it, practically sneering the whole time, before tossing it back down on the table like it was trash. He said "Congratulations on becoming a third rate game company. If you ever become a second rate company we'll crush you."</p>
      <P id="quote">Lisa wouldn't say who the guy was or what his exact position was at TSR, but she told the story fondly. She closed the story by saying "I'll just say I got his office when we bought TSR years later."</P>
