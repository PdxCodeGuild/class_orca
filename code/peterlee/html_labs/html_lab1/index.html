    <h1>The Life of Muhammad Ali</h1>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Muhammad_Ali_NYWTS.jpg/220px-Muhammad_Ali_NYWTS.jpg">
    <p>Muhammad Ali was an American professional boxer, a staunch activist, and a cultural icon.<br>
    Finishing his professional boxing career with a record of 56-5, his nickname was the greatest<br> 
    and he is considered by many to be the greatest boxer of all time. He received great notoriety<br>
    for refusing to be drafted into the military and fighting in the Vietnam War due to his religious<br>
    beliefs. He was arrested for draft evasion and stripped of his titles though the conviction was<br>
    overturned at a later time. Ali eventually was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and eventually<br>
    succumbed to it many years later at the age of 74. Even after his death, his impact on culture<br>
    globally can still be felt due to the incredible life that he led.</p>
