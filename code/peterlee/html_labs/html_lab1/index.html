    <h1>The Life of Muhammad Ali</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Muhammad Ali was an American professional boxer, a staunch activist, and a cultural icon.</p>
    <p>Finishing his professional boxing career with a record of 56-5, his nickname was the greatest </p>
    <p>and he is considered by many to be the greatest boxer of all time. He received great notoriety</p>
    <p>for refusing to be drafted into the military and fighting in the Vietnam War due to his religious</p>
    <p>beliefs. He was arrested for draft evasion and stripped of his titles though the conviction was</p>
    <p>overturned at a later time. Ali eventually was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and eventually</p>
    <p>succumbed to it many years later at the age of 74. Even after his death, his impact on culture</p>
    <p>globally can still be felt due to the incredible life that he led.</p>
