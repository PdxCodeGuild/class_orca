    <h1>The Life of Muhammad Ali</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Muhammad Ali was an American professional boxer, a staunch activist, and a cultural icon.
    Finishing his professional boxing career with a record of 56-5, his nickname was the greatest 
    and he is considered by many to be the greatest boxer of all time. He received great notoriety
    for refusing to be drafted into the military and fighting in the Vietnam War due to his religious
    beliefs. He was arrested for draft evasion and stripped of his titles though the conviction was
    overturned at a later time. Ali eventually was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and eventually
    succumbed to it many years later at the age of 74. Even after his death, his impact on culture
    globally can still be felt due to the incredible life that he led.</p>
