    <p> Q: Comrade Laika, apart from the obvious differences, how do you assess
        the differences in human and nonhuman astronauts?</p>
    <p>
        A: Aside from the obvious differences, I don't think there are any.

        "The flight was extremely normal...for the first 36 seconds. Then after that got very interesting"</p>
    <p>
        "I progressed through my schooling, undergraduate and graduate degrees, excited about math and science and engineering, but really didn't think about being an astronaut at that point. It was kind of unreachable."
