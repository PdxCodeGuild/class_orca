    <blockquote>Anton Pavlovich Chekhov <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Chekhov">wiki page</a> (Russian: Антон Павлович Чехов[note 1], IPA: [ɐnˈton ˈpavɫəvʲɪtɕ ˈtɕɛxəf]; 29 January 1860[note 2] – 15 July 1904[note 3]) was a Russian playwright and short-story writer who is considered to be among the greatest writers of short fiction in history. His career as a playwright produced four classics, and his best short stories are held in high esteem by writers and critics.[3][4] Along with Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg, Chekhov is often referred to as one of the three seminal figures in the birth of early modernism in the theatre.</blockquote>
