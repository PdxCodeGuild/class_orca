    <h2>Bill Gates Bio</h2>

    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    <p> Undoubtably, one of the most important figures in information and computer
        technology. As an entrepreneur and businessman, Bill Gates and his business 
        partner, Paul Allen, founded and built the world's largest software business, 
        Microsoft, through technological innovation, keen business strategy and 
        aggressive business tactics. In the process, Gates became one of the richest 
        men in the world. Beyond Microsoft, Bill Gates evolved to become one of the most 
        prolific active philanthropists the world has ever seen. </p>
