# Lab 22: Compute Automated Readability Index

# Compute the ARI for a given body of text loaded in from a file. The automated readability index (ARI) is a formula for computing the U.S. grade level for a given block of text. The general formula to compute the ARI is as follows:

# ARI Formula

# The score is computed by multiplying the number of characters divided by the number of words by 4.17, adding the number of words divided by the number of sentences multiplied by 0.5, and subtracting 21.43. If the result is a decimal, always round up. Scores greater than 14 should be presented as having the same age and grade level as scores of 14.

# Scores correspond to the following ages and grad levels:

#     Score  Ages     Grade Level
#      1       5-6    Kindergarten
#      2       6-7    First Grade
#      3       7-8    Second Grade
#      4       8-9    Third Grade
#      5      9-10    Fourth Grade
#      6     10-11    Fifth Grade
#      7     11-12    Sixth Grade
#      8     12-13    Seventh Grade
#      9     13-14    Eighth Grade
#     10     14-15    Ninth Grade
#     11     15-16    Tenth Grade
#     12     16-17    Eleventh grade
#     13     17-18    Twelfth grade
#     14     18-22    College

# Once youâ€™ve computed the ARI score, you can use the following dictionary to look up the age range and grade level.

# The output should look something like the following:

# --------------------------------------------------------

# The ARI for gettysburg-address.txt is 12
# This corresponds to a 11th Grade level of difficulty
# that is suitable for an average person 16-17 years old.

# --------------------------------------------------------
