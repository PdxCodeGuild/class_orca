    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    
    <pre>
There once was a cartoon named Trump. 
He said once: his white house was a dump.

He always lived in luxury,
Never helped a bumble-bee,
Or heard of reciprocity.</pre>

        Nobody has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln--possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I've done.

<!-- Block and Inline Elements
Block elements will take up the full available width and force other elements to move to a new line. Examples of block elements are p, h1, div, ol/ul, and form.
Inline elements only take the amount of space they need, and allow other elements to exist on the same line. Examples of inline elements are span, img, and a. -->

    A written introduction

    A picture of them (or a placeholder)
    A list of places where they've lived
    A quote from them

Part 2

    Center the entire content of the body
    Add / pick an existing image in one of the sections and float it
    Modify the padding and margins on your paragraphs to look better

Part 3

    Pick a color scheme and modify the background, body text, and link text color.
    Change the typeface of the quote.
    Add a rounded border to the picture.
    Change the bullet points on the list of places to be a different character, like â˜ž.

Part 4

    Peruse the complete HTML element list and try to incorporate some of them. -->
