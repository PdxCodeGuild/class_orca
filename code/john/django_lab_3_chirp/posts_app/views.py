# WORKING ON COMMENT SYSTEM ... 
# 
# Notes from Merritt convo: 
# - comment system
# 	- or, more complicated (something else? What was it...)
# 	- foreign key (or keys?)
# 	- thinking about/working with DB is good
# 	- do whichever is more of a challenge
# 
# FROM https://github.com/PdxCodeGuild/class_orca/blob/main/3%20Django/labs/lab05-blog.md
    # Comment
    #         user: a many-to-one relationship to the User table
    #         blogpost: foreign reference to blogpost
    #         body: text of the comment's body
    #         timestamp: when the comment was made
    # Pages
    # These pages should be protected, meaning the views which serve them should check the permissions of the user attempting to access them.
    #     Post List: Show only the post title, username, and the timestamp.
    #     Post Detail: Show the post title, username, and timestamp, as well as the body and the comments. Each comment should show the user, the timestamp, and the comment body. The comment section should also have a text area for users to enter new comments.
    #     Make Post: Allow posters to create new posts.
# 
# https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/web_development/9781784391911/2/ch02lvl1sec19/creating-a-comment-system
# To build the comment system, you will need to:
#     Create a model to save comments
#     Create a form to submit comments and validate the input data
#     Add a view that processes the form and saves the new comment into the database
#     Edit the post detail template to display the list of comments and the form for adding a new comment
