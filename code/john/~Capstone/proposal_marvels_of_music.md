- Marvels of Music should let a user input their song, save its lyrics and guitar tabs/piano chords, maybe stream the music, download their MIDI version if one exists, 
- Childhood Canvas should, first and foremost, start with a blank fullscreen white/black screen. Then, any key/button pressed should provide a visual output mode

### Features Marvels of Music

- Features
- 'User Stories' -- sentences describing what the user should need/solve/how/etc 
- Elevator Pitch
- User stories follow this template: "As a _____ (user), I want _____ (feature) because _____ (reason)."*
