        <p>Where do I begin. Our Lord and Savior Samwise Gamgee was as good of a guy as they come. Humble,
            strong, brave, and fiercy loyal to that absolute idiot Frodo. I mean I'm sorry, if I was Sam 
            I would've ditched Frodo back at the Shire and carried that stupid ring up the mountain myself, 
            all he really did was hold Sam back, and please don't get me started on Frodo trusting that pale 
            sardine with the bad teeth Golum. Anyway to make a long story short Samwise pretty much
             saved the entire planet from destruction, then when it was all said and done goes back to the Shire 
             to marry his crush and pop out a couple of RugRats to live happily ever after. He's a real stand up dude.
